```Project Discussion and Setup
- this dataset is an export from conversations on gitter, a chat application similar to Slack.
<https://gitter.im/>
- Here are the project requirement and Q&amp;A docs for reference. I believe you already have it, but it's good to keep them here.
- I'll check
- <@U06RU2JKMDG> you can join my team at RunPod using this link
```<https://www.runpod.io/console/user/invite/clv163u5c0000mi08a61ecuf1>```
- <@U047WSYBE5T> Done. Added $30 and invited <@U06RU2JKMDG>
- Hi <@U066Q9JAU3B>, I'm reaching out to request access to Cloud Sys. It would be ideal if you could choose RunPod service as the Cloud Sys for our project. If possible, please create an account there and add <@U06RU2JKMDG> (<mailto:maksym.lysyi@litslink.com|maksym.lysyi@litslink.com>) to the team, granting him admin permissions.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
- here is the link where I got the data from - <https://figshare.com/s/3fd5af0b869b8fd010bb> . We are not 'training' a new model using this data, so we should have theoretically no licensing issues.
- <@U066Q9JAU3B>, we recommend registering on <http://runpod.io|runpod.io>, making a deposit (we suggest $30 should be sufficient), and adding Maksym to the team.


LLM experimentation
- Good meeting <@U05R0KHPU8N> <@U047WSYBE5T>, here are my notes
1. Mongodb integration
    a. The model now stores the output in 'archive' database of mongodb. Please do checkin this code on GitHub, so I can test it out.
    b. Next step: Ensure input messages are also in mongodb. We will need to modify the api such that we can pass only the collection name, number of messages et
- Hi, <@U066Q9JAU3B> thanks!
I will take a look.

She is interested in cloud services, specifically using RunPod for her projects, and has experience inviting team members and managing permissions. Mariia also has experience with LLM experimentation and MongoDB integration, reviewing code changes, and modifying APIs.


Project Discussion and Setup
- I've created a new branch named 'setup' to work on the project setup.
- I made a new folder called 'setup' and added the following files:
	* requirements.txt
	* docker-compose.yml
	* dockerfile
- I've written the necessary code to set up the project using docker-compose.
- The setup consists of three services:
	* app
	* db
	* redis
- The app service is a FastAPI application that uses Uvicorn as the ASGI server.
- The db service is a PostgreSQL database that stores the data.
- The redis service is a Redis instance that is used for caching.
- To start the project, run 'docker-compose up' in the 'setup' folder.
- The application will be available at <http://localhost:8000>.
- I've also added a 'makefile' to simplify the setup process.
- Running 'make start' will start the project.
- Running 'make stop' will stop the project.
- Running 'make test' will run the tests.
- Running 'make lint' will lint the code.
- Running 'make format' will format the code.
- I've added a '.env' file to store the environment variables.
- The '.env' file should contain the following variables:
	* DATABASE_URL
	* REDIS_URL
	* SECRET_KEY

- I've created a new branch named 'llm-exp' to work on LLM experimentation.
- I've added a new file called 'llm.py' to the 'llm-exp' branch.
- The 'llm.py' file contains the code for the LLM experimentation.
- The LLM experimentation uses the following libraries:
	* transformers
	* torch
	* numpy
	* pandas
	* tqdm
- The LLM experimentation consists of the following steps:
	* Load the data
	* Preprocess the data
	* Train the model
	* Evaluate the model
	* Store the results
- The LLM experimentation uses the following models:
	* BERT
	* RoBERTa
	* DistilBERT
	* XLNet
- The LLM experimentation uses the following evaluation metrics:
	* Accuracy
	* F1 score
	* Precision
	* Recall
- I've added a new file called 'results.txt' to store the results of the LLM experimentation.
- The 'results.txt' file contains the following information:
	* Model name
	* Evaluation metric
	* Score
- The LLM experimentation is still in progress. I will update the 'results.txt' file as I make more progress.

Yogesh is a developer who is working on a project setup using Docker and FastAPI. He has created a new branch named 'setup' and added files such as requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml, dockerfile, and makefile to simplify the setup process. Yogesh has also set up three services: app, db, and redis, using PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching. He is also working on LLM experimentation using models such as BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and XLNet, and evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Yogesh has created a new branch named 'llm-exp' and added a file called 'llm.py' for the LLM experimentation. He has also created a file called 'results.txt' to store the results of the experimentation.

Model Evaluation
- I've updated the 'results.txt' file with the latest evaluation scores for the LLM models.
- The BERT model achieved an accuracy of 0.85, an F1 score of 0.82, a precision of 0.84, and a recall of 0.81.
- The RoBERTa model achieved an accuracy of 0.87, an F1 score of 0.84, a precision of 0.86, and a recall of 0.83.
- The DistilBERT model achieved an accuracy of 0.81, an F1 score of 0.78, a precision of 0.80, and a recall of 0.77.
- The XLNet model achieved an accuracy of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.83, a precision of 0.85, and a recall of 0.82.
- Based on the evaluation scores, the RoBERTa model performs the best on our dataset.
- I've also added a new file called 'confusion_matrix.png' that shows the confusion matrix for each model.
- The confusion matrix provides a more detailed view of the model's performance, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- I've also added a new file called 'roc_curve.png' that shows the ROC curve for each model.
- The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the model's performance at different classification thresholds.
- I've also added a new file called 'precision_recall_curve.png' that shows the precision-recall curve for each model.
- The precision-recall curve provides a visual representation of the model's performance in terms of precision and recall.
- Based on the evaluation metrics and visualizations, we can make informed decisions about which model to use for our application.
