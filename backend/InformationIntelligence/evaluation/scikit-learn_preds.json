The result was very good! :smile: \\nI know that you are a member of the core team of scikit learn so I'd like to thank you, sklearn is so awesome!. \\nJust one more question: Is there any easy way to get the name of the features?  So often I needed to print out the names in order to understand the relationship between them and the different classes. I wrote some code that gather the information of the different vocabularies in the case of the textual or categorical features and the name of the column in the case of the numerical ones. \\nSorry for my bad english!

I proposed a fix in one of the issues. Maybe just remove the implementation of ``fit_transform``, that is use the naive fit.transform, and mask out sample_weight=0.
